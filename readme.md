# Linkable Metronome

A browser-based metronome that lets you bookmark a specific tempo (in beats per minute). 

For example
[119 BPM](https://martin-stone.github.io/linkable-metronome/?bpm=119),
[120 BPM](https://martin-stone.github.io/linkable-metronome/?bpm=120),
[121 BPM](https://martin-stone.github.io/linkable-metronome/?bpm=121).

You can use the buttons on the metronome page to change the tempo, or set the BPM at the end of the URL:

> https://martin-stone.github.io/linkable-metronome/?bpm=120

You can paste the URL into any practice schedule document that you use, to easily jump straight to the BPM for each piece.
